                    <h2>How We Began</h2>
                    <p>Bake It Up was founded by friends Liam Dowd and Evan McManus. The pair shared a passion for
                        experimenting with different kinds of desserts, constantly throwing new ideas at the baking table.
                        They spent the early part of their baking careers jotting down what worked, and learning from
                        what didn't.</p>
                    <p>Dowd and McManus continued to gather experience working in several different bakeries throughout
                        Dublin, up until 2012, when they decided on opening a small bakery called Bake It Up. In it's
                        inception, the bakery had a small, but loyal, following. People familiar with the place returned on the
                        regular, looking for their fill of the <strong>sweet treats</strong> they grew familiar with.
                        Word of mouth spread, and Bake It Up became a common name in the streets of Dublin.</p>
                    <p>Bake It Up became so successful that Dowd and McManus had to move to a bigger location, to accomodate
                        the needs of its growing fan base. The bakery was moved to Wood Quay, where it continues to satisfy
                        the sugar cravings of its happy pastryholics!</p>
