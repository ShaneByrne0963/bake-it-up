                <h2>How We Began</h2>
                <p>Bake It Up was founded by friends <strong>Liam Dowd</strong> and <strong>Evan McManus</strong>. The pair shared a passion for
                    experimenting with different kinds of desserts, constantly throwing new ideas at the baking table, jotting down what worked,
                    and learning from what didn't.</p>
                <p>In 2012, they decided on opening a small bakery called Bake It Up. In it's
                    inception, the bakery had a small, but loyal, following. People familiar with the place returned on the
                    regular, word of mouth spread, and Bake It Up became a common name in the streets of Dublin.</p>
                <p>Bake It Up became so successful that Dowd and McManus had to move to a bigger location, to accomodate
                    the needs of its growing fan base. The bakery was moved to Wood Quay, where it continues to satisfy
                    the sugar cravings of its happy pastryholics!</p>
