# Bake It Up

## Introduction

Bake It Up is a concept of a bakery based in Dublin where customers have the option to place orders for bread, pastries and cakes, with the ability to alter the properties of their goods to their liking. The aim of the website is to provide an online platform that allows its user's access to the same range of possibilities as they would be given if they were to place their order in-store, along with fully automating the commercial process, from accepting payments to compiling a list of orders for the day.

This e-commerce website was produced using Stripe Payments and the Django framework, and was designed with the help of Bootstrap.

## Design Thinking Process

> *"Why would a user want to visit our website?"*

- To make an order of bread, pastries and/or cakes online
- To get more information about the bakery

> *"What would make them return?"*

- A user-friendly website that makes the ordering process as simple and pain-free as possible
- An assortment of controls and options to change their orders where they see fit

### Problem Statement

*"How can we fully transfer the creative freedoms that our in-person patrons have into the online world?"*

### Solutions

> *"Why would a user want to visit our website?"*

- To make an order of bread, pastries and/or cakes online
  - Bake It Up's products are easily accessible throughout the site, with each category of products situated within the navigation at the top of the page
  - Products can be filtered by category, searched using a query, and sorted by their name, price, and number of favourites, in ascending or descending order. This makes finding products much easier as users can simply input their most desired features they are looking for in their products
  - Logged in users can also add products to their favourites, as well as filter products to only display their favourites, which is extremely useful for regular customers regularly buying their usual items, as they don't need to navigate through the products they know they don't want
- To get more information about the bakery
  - Upon entering the site, users are greeted with an array of images in the form of a carousel, in order to display a high volume of information distributed in an easy-to-read manner, while also taking up minimal space

  - Each image in the carousel is accompanied with a short sentence and a CTA button, allowing the users to directly maneuver to the part of the site that peaks their interest
  - The details about the physical bakery are present in the footer of every page. This is a general standard for most business websites. Here, users can find information about the address of the business, their phone number, email address and opening hours.

> *"What would make them return?"*

- A user-friendly website that makes the ordering process as simple and pain-free as possible
  - As described above, adding products to the user's cart is designed to be as straightforward as possible
  - Once the user is happy with their order, the process of checking out is also simple, hiding the delivery section behind a checkbox to prevent an overwhelming clutter of inputs for users not looking to have their products delivered
  - Logged in users can save their information to their profile, making their next order even easier as they no longer have to fill out their details again
- An assortment of controls and options to change their orders where they see fit
  - Every product can have multiple properties attached to it. These properties for each category are as follows:
    - **Bread**: shape, size and contents
    - **Pastries**: type, contents, colour, icing, decoration and text
  - Pastry products have more options because they are more complex than breads, and can be made of multiple parts and can have differnt layers
  - These properties have been implemented to only be a guideline, and can be freely edited to say whatever is applicable to the product
