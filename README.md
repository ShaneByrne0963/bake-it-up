# Bake It Up

## Introduction

Bake It Up is a concept of a bakery based in Dublin where customers have the option to place orders for bread, pastries and cakes, with the ability to alter the properties of their goods to their liking. The aim of the website is to provide an online platform that allows its user's access to the same range of possibilities as they would be given if they were to place their order in-store, along with fully automating the commercial process, from accepting payments to compiling a list of orders for the day.

This e-commerce website was produced using Stripe Payments and the Django framework, and was designed with the help of Bootstrap.
